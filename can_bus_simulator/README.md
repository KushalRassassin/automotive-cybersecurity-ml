## CAN Bus Simulator
This module simulates basic CAN traffic to understand normal behavior and common attack patterns such as replay and spoofing.
Initial focus:
- Generate normal CAN frames
- Log CAN messages
- Extend to malicious traffic simulation
### Current Status
- [x] Normal CAN traffic generation
- [ ] Attack traffic simulation
- [ ] Real-time CAN stream
